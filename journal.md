# Journal Entry - 2025-01-10

## Tasks Done

- Initialized the django project.

- Setup postgres database.

- Created Apps home and JSON_Parser.

- Created first test for a basic view and made the view to pass.

## Challenges

- During setup i took a lot of time to configure postgres. Had a hiccup with it when making the first test as well. Needed to find out how to make a test database for the tests.


## Next Steps

- Now that i should have the project (as far as i know) ready. I should be able to start the next part.

- I will implement a "walking skeleton" technique from TDD. To do that i will implement displaying my projects on the home page. That will include frontend-backend-database and back again.
