# ToDo's

## Tests

    - I need to check the tests if all work like they should after backblaze b2 integration
    - make a test/tests for b2 storage

## Mobile view in project view

    - The dropdown menu is not aligned. Need to make it span the whole screen.
    - Mobile view when looked at horizontal is off. especially the hero section. Probably should change text size for mobile view as well.

## Journal

    - Update journal

## Project list view when more than 4 projects

    - I want a archive of all projects where i can put old projects that wont make the front page anymore

    - It should have tech tags to filter projects based on tech
